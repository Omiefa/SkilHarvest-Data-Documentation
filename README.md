By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gether enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enables us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

## Data Sources
The primary source of Data used is Data Sale.csv and this is open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site

## Tools Used
- Ms Excel for Data Cleaning [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)
- Power BI (For Reporting)
- Ms PowerPoint (For Presentation)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) invloves exploring the Data to answer some critical question about the Data such as:
- What is the overall sales trend
